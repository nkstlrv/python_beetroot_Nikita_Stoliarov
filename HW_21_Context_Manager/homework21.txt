Task 1

File Context Manager class

Create your own class, which can behave like a built-in function `open`.
Also, you need to extend its functionality with counter and logging.
Pay special attention to the implementation of `__exit__` method,
which has to cover all the requirements to context managers

Task 2

Writing tests for context manager

Take your implementation of the context manager class from Task 1 and write tests for it.
Try to cover as many use cases as you can, positive ones when a file exists and everything works as designed.
And also, write tests when your class raises errors, or you have errors in the runtime context suite.


Task 3 (Optional)

Pytest fixtures with context manager

Create a simple function, which performs any logic of your choice with text data,
which it obtains from a file object, passed to this function ( def test(file_obj) ).

Create a test case for this function using pytest library (Full pytest documentation).

Create pytest fixture, which uses your implementation of the context manager to return a file object,
which could be used inside your function.
